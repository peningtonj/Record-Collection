-- Migration 1: Change albums to use composite primary key (name, primary_artist) instead of spotify_id
-- This handles cases where Spotify changes album IDs

-- Note: This migration is handled programmatically in AlbumKeyMigration.kt
-- because SQLite doesn't support complex migrations easily through ALTER statements.
-- SQLDelight will track this version number but the actual migration logic
-- is in the Kotlin migration class.
