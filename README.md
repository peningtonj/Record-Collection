# Record Collection

This is an app which provides an alternative front end to Spotify, designed for listening to full albums.

## Importing data into the app

If you have albums saved to your library in Spotify, you can import your saved albums into the app with the _Sync with Spotify Saved Albums_ button.

You can continue to use both the spotify app and Record Collection to add albums to your library, and the sync button will allow you to combine your libraries, or override one library with the other.

You can also fill your library by importing collections as detailed below.

## Collections

Collections are playlists of albums. You can add albums to the collection and play them in order, or shuffled. In between each album, it will add a short sound effect between albums. This can be turned off in the settings.

### Importing Collections

You can import collections from:
1. Playlists in Spotify (Every album from which a song in the playlist appears)
2. An article about a list of songs (Requires an Open AI API key)

## Playing Music

You must have an available Spotify device to play music.

## Other Features
* Rating albums
* Filtering on release date
* Every Noise At Once data for tagging by genre
* Capacity to swap between releases and special editions
* Deduplication of Albums 

The app is written in Kotlin and is heavily inspired by the [kotify](https://github.com/dzirbel/kotify) project by Dominic Zirbel.
